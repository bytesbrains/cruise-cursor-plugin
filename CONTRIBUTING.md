# Contributing

Thanks for caring about the plugin. This repo is the source of truth for the `cruise` plugin
for Cursor and the `bytesbrains` marketplace that serves it. It used to be copied here
from BytesBrains Cruise on each release; now all development happens here.

## Ground rules

- **Never commit a Cruise key.** The plugin reads `CRUISE_API_KEY` from the plugin variables at run
  time and never writes it anywhere: not to a settings file, not to the MCP config.
- **No telemetry, no second host.** The plugin reaches only the Cruise base URL the user
  configures.
- **`/cruise-setup` asks before it changes a file.** It stays `disable-model-invocation: true`,
  so only the user can start it.
- **Every change is a pull request into `main`**, one concern each.

## Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bytesbrains/cruise-cursor-plugin.git
cd cruise-cursor-plugin
npm ci
```

`npm ci` runs `prepare`, which points `core.hooksPath` at `.githooks/`. **pre-commit** runs
`gitleaks protect` on the staged diff, and **pre-push** runs `gitleaks detect` over the full
history. Both use `.gitleaks.toml`, which includes the Cruise key shapes. The hooks need
[gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) (`brew install gitleaks`) and fail if it is
missing. That is on purpose.

## Checks

```sh
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run secrets:scan
```

CI runs the same checks on every pull request and on every push to `main`. The required status
check is named `check`. `test/plugin.test.ts` holds the plugin's contract. It checks that:

- the manifest and the marketplace agree;
- the MCP config reads the key from plugin variables and never carries one;
- no file carries a Cruise key;
- every skill says when it applies;
- setup does not claim Agent CLI inference goes through Cruise.

## Trying a local build

```sh
agent --plugin-dir ./plugins/cruise
```

For a key that costs nothing, use `CRUISE_BASE_URL=https://cruise-demo.bytesbrains.net`
with a `cru_demo_` key.

## Releasing (maintainers)

A release is a **tag** that a person cuts. Bump `plugins/cruise/.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`'s
`version` on every release, then submit at cursor.com/marketplace/publish:

1. In the pull request that makes the change, bump `version` in
   `plugins/cruise/.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`, and match it in `package.json`. The test
   checks that the two agree. Keep `version` out of `marketplace.json`.
2. Merge it once `check` is green.
3. Tag that commit on `main` and push the tag:

```sh
git fetch origin
git tag v0.x.y origin/main
git push origin v0.x.y
```

The tag must match the manifest (`v0.1.0` ↔ `"0.1.0"`). A bad release is fixed by the next
version, not by moving a tag.
